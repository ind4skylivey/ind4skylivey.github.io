The Codex is a living manuscript—inked on soft paper, annotated in neon gel pen, updated whenever practice reveals a new truth. These articles guide every cyberdeck engagement.

## Article I · Consent Before Curiosity

> *Authorization is the soil. Without it, nothing ethical can grow.*

- Obtain written approval, confirm scope verbally, then confirm once more before tooling.
- Decline engagements that weaponize knowledge against communities or consent.

## Article II · Transparency Is a Tool

- Document every pivot, every payload, every hunch.
- Share methodologies so clients inherit clarity, not just fixes.

## Article III · Care for Surfaces & Spirits

- Harden systems without harming their caretakers.
- Deliver remediation notes with the same warmth as vulnerabilities.

## Article IV · Engineering as Ceremony

- Begin complex builds with grounding rituals: breathwork, Miyuki check-in, scope review.
- End with aftercare: debrief, gratitude, rest, archival.

## Article V · Open Intelligence, Warmly Held

- Automation should amplify human judgment, not replace accountability.
- Publish knowledge generously; redact only when safety requires it.

Carry this Codex back to technical pages whenever the work feels sharp. Kindness is an exploit path too—aim it toward better worlds.
