Stroll the gravel path, listen for wind chimes shaped like command keys, and draw a card whenever you need rooted guidance.

## Garden Practices

- **Sketch & Sense** – After drawing a card, sketch the first shape that arrives. Insight often hides in loose lines.
- **Soil Notes** – Keep a short log of what nourished you each week. Patterns emerge like stepping stones.
- **Shared Seeds** – Offer one garden card to a collaborator and ask which tool it transforms.

The garden changes with seasons—new cards sprout whenever experience deepens. Return often; the paths remember your footsteps.
