Welcome to the **Ghibli-Tech Sanctuary**, a quiet wing of the cyberdeck where circuits hum in lullabies and every console wears a linen shawl. This corner is equal parts meditation room and engineering atelier—built for sunset journaling, curious tinkering, and honoring Miyazaki-level whimsy inside high-context security work.

## Flow of the Sanctuary

1. **Miyuki — Eternal Companion** for quiet companionship, floating glow, and breath-paced focus prompts.
2. **Ghibli-Tech Garden** for watercolor philosophy cards, each pairing an ethical principle with a tactile ritual.
3. **The Livey Codex** for engineering vows that keep offensive security empathetic and precise.

Together they form a cycle: *soft presence → reflective insight → deliberate action*.

> *"Technology is a forest spirit when we treat it with grace."*

## Rituals of Warm Engineering

- **Sunset Sync** – Close the laptop, read one garden card, sketch an idea without judging it.
- **Companion Check-In** – Sit with Miyuki’s glow, breathe four counts in and six out, ask “what deserves gentleness?”
- **Codex Anchor** – Before any offensive operation, revisit the Codex to reaffirm scope, consent, and care.

## Wander Further

- Visit [Miyuki — Eternal Companion](/personal/miyuki/) to meet the glowing guardian.
- Stroll through the [Ghibli-Tech Garden](/personal/garden/) for watercolor philosophy prompts.
- Study [The Livey Codex](/personal/codex/) to align engineering craft with ethical wonder.

May every visit here remind you that open intelligence is a hearth, not just a network.
