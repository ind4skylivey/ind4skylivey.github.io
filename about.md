# About

I’m Livey — an Open Intelligence Engineer blending **cybersecurity**, **reverse engineering**, **AI-assisted development**, and **Linux architecture**.

I design systems, frameworks, and workflows that break closed chains, unlock hardware and software potential, and give developers and researchers more leverage in their daily work.

**Core stack:** PHP (Laravel), Python, Rust, Bash, Local AI.  
**Focus areas:** Vulnerability research, red teaming, malware analysis, performance tuning, observability, and developer tooling.

## Principles

- Open systems and ethical hacking.  
- Clean, maintainable, and observable code.  
- Automation that respects users and empowers creators.  
- Security as a craft, not a checkbox.  
- Tools as extensions of thought.
