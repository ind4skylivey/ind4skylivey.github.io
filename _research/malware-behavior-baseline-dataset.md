# Containerized Malware Baselines: Defining Behavioral Ground Truth

## Precision + Reverse Engineering + Datasets + Reproducibility (Container-Nerd Style)

This research outlines a robust pipeline for constructing a reliable behavioral dataset by executing well-known (non-dangerous) malware samples within rootless containers, leveraging strictly controlled internal networks.

We focus on the systematic collection of critical telemetry:
*   DNS lookups
*   HTTP/S beacons
*   Process creation trees
*   CPU/RAM consumption profiles
*   Binary section entropy
*   Generated Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

The methodology includes techniques for effectively tagging behaviors to feed offline analytical models and security dashboards. Special attention is given to the automated export of PCAP files and comprehensive reports for each analyzed sample.

A core discussion revolves around distinguishing "normal" system behavior from "malicious noise" and establishing an offensive "Ground Truth" for known malware.

**Expected Outcome:** An example repository featuring automation scripts, a minimal reference dataset with 5-10 public samples, architectural diagrams, and collection benchmarks.
