### ⚡ TL;DR

Developers increasingly rely on AI to generate boilerplate and logic. But how secure is this code "out of the box"? This research performs a systematic security audit of code produced by popular GenAI models, focusing on common vulnerability classes (OWASP Top 10).

### 🔬 Core Research Areas

1.  **Empirical Audit:** Generating and analyzing hundreds of code snippets for standard tasks (auth, DB queries, file handling).
2.  **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying recurring insecure patterns (e.g., hardcoded secrets, lack of input sanitization).
3.  **SAST Evaluation:** Running Static Application Security Testing tools against AI-generated code.
4.  **Remediation:** Developing "fix-it" prompts and guidelines for securely integrating GenAI code.

**Expected Outcome:** A catalog of "AI-native" vulnerabilities, statistical safety ratings for different prompting strategies, and a developer's guide to safe AI adoption.
