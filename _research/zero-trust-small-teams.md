# Zero-Trust for Small Teams
## Practical Implementation Without Enterprise Budgets

---

> **PROJECT STATUS:** `PLANNED` 🟡
> **FOCUS:** Identity · Access Control · Network Segmentation
> **TARGET:** Startups · Small Engineering Teams

### ⚡ TL;DR

Zero Trust is often marketed as an expensive enterprise solution. This research explores how small teams can implement core ZT principles (verify explicitly, least privilege, assume breach) using open-source tools and smart configuration, rather than costly appliances.

### 🔬 Core Research Areas

1.  **Identity Management:** Securing access without expensive SSO.
2.  **Device Trust:** enforcing health checks on developer machines.
3.  **Network Micro-segmentation:** Protecting internal resources (WireGuard/Tailscale).
4.  **Policy Enforcement:** verifiable access logs and audit trails.

**Expected Outcome:** A "Zero-Trust Starter Kit" for teams under 50 people.
